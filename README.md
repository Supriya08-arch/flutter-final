Introduction
</h1>
E-commerce is fast gaining ground as an accepted and widely used business tool. Shopping on the app is becoming more common. The objective of this project is to develop a general-purpose e-commerce store where any kind of clothes and shoes can be bought from the comfort of home through the internet.
A virtual store on the Internet where customers can browse the catalog and select products of interest is known as an online store. The chosen items can be placed in a shopping cart. The items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order during the checkout process. More information will be required at that time to complete the transaction. The customer is usually asked to fill out or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping option, and payment information such as a credit card number and also a registered email address.

Ship-Shop an ecommerce site to buy your preferred clothing at your preferred price.
<h1>
Description:
</h1>
 
Ship-Shop is an e-commerce application where you can easily get your clothes and shoes. Not only fashion wear, but also branded clothing and activewear are available. The working process of this system is an Android-based application which smooths the process of buying clothing. This project has two sides: one is admin and the other is customer "user". In this system, both administrators and users have their own dashboard. To use this application, users must first install and download it. Once installed, this application will remain on the device until the user deletes it. The customer or user must register themselves as a user. Users have their own username and password after registering, and they can login themselves. After logging in, there are clothes and shoes that are necessary, and the user can pick them up. A user can add that product to the cart and proceed with payment methods. Also, users can give reviews and ratings for the product. On the other hand, the admin can add, delete, or edit products. The benefit of this is faster response to buyer/market demands.
<h1>
Features
</h1>

User Profile:
The user has the ability to edit their profiles, such as changing their name and password. Also, the admin has access to the list of users and how many users are there. The admin also has access to delete the user. Not only users, but admins too, can edit their profiles.
Product editing:
The online clothing app makes it easier for user to easily look for the product. Admin can  simply add, delete, and edit it. They can also add the product description to the product. The user can see the available stock of that particular product and also the admin can. If it is out of stock, then admin can add the product or delete it, and the user will also be aware if the product is available or not.
Adding product to cart:
If the user is willing to buy the product, they must add their products to their carts, which afterwards will make you process towards the payment method. After adding it to the cart, you can also increase or decrease your quantity, or completely delete it from the cart.
Order Product:
Nowadays, almost everything is purchased online. So, this application also wants to make users' lives easier by giving users the ability to buy their wanted products online. To make an order, you need to make your payment first, then only the user's order will be added to the order list from where the user can see the order details.
Payment method:
Online payment has taken the market all over the world. Adding online payment will give users more functionality in this application. Users can simply make their payment through their credit card, also adding their registered address and phone numbers.
Rating and Favorite:
As the user's choice matters most to us, what kinds of products they like and dislike are the best ways of advancing their own business or productivity? In order to do that, rating the product methods are added to this application. The user can easily give a rating through the stars and add a review in the small review comment box. User can also marked their favorite product and keep them in favorite list 
<h1>
Results and benefits:
</h1>
  
Both the user admin and the customer will find this application very useful. As it is a faster buying process, store and product listing creation, there are no reach restrictions. Product and price comparison allows faster response to buyer/market demands, and it is also easy to use.

Technologies used
</h1>

Front end development, also known as user interface (UI) development, is the portion of software development which is visible to consumers. It converts the complex backend section into a user-friendly perspective by using graphics. It strives for the best performance, speed, and availability possible. The front-end development technologies used for this application are listed below:
1. JavaScript
JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS, is one of the most popular scripting languages on the Internet. It was interactive and included features such as scrolling, clicking, pop-ups, advertisements, asynchronous calls, and so on. It is the client-side foundation of several frontend frameworks and gives life to websites.
Important Characteristics
• It is portable and lightweight. prototype-based and single-threaded
• Object-oriented programming is supported.
• both declarative and mandatory 
• the ability to perform built-in functions 
• customer-focused technology 
• careful formatting
Node JS 2
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform environment for building servers and communication networks. Node.js applications can run on Linux, OS X, and Microsoft Windows while supporting JavaScript. The extensive collection of different JavaScript modules provided by Node.js makes it easier to create large-scale web applications.
Important Characteristics
• Event-driven and asynchronous 
• Extremely fast
• Extremely scalable, but only single-threaded.
3. Flutter
The popular open-source UI framework known as Flutter can build cross-platform apps that are adaptable and mimic native functionality using a single codebase. It is one of the most rapidly developing frontend frameworks for flexible and powerful designs.
Important Characteristics
• A more modern, versatile, and visually appealing user interface.
 • A single code base that spans multiple platforms for faster and easier app testing and coding.
 • Hot Reload is a powerful feature for speedy development.
Backend
The back-end is the server-side part of the software that handles data storage and analysis as well as the overall performance of the application. Back-end developers work with system components, business processes, and data architectures in addition to APIs and libraries. This application's data is stored using MongoDB as the primary server. The database consists of collections only. MongoDB has no schema, so you don't need to correlate the documents in your collection. All data is saved as a BSON document with key/value pairs. MongoDB converts JSON data to binary BSON in the background. Hierarchical data is also supported by MongoDB. As a result, data collection is relatively fast.
<h1>
Project Architecture
</h1> 
The developed code is well-structured and reusable thanks to MVVM sequencing. The acronym MVVM, which stands for Model, View, and View Model, is used to organize code in order to run tested, extensible, and maintainable programs. Views have no effect on model views. This means that XML UI views can only have a limited number of items added without affecting anything else. This reduces the number of user interface requirements. It removes some display options and replaces them with new ones. In addition to achieving separation, the MVVM approach allows for model and view separation. The MVVM model's effectiveness stems from its ability to generate a consistent, easy-to-modify model without testing. In MVVM implementations, testability, maintainability, and scalability are critical factors. 
Challenges:

• Unable to use the Emulator.
• An error occurred while connecting to the wear OS.
• After posting from Postman, the data did not appear in the database.
• Constant UI change.
• Difficulty in implementing the payment feature.
• The images could not be loaded.
• Difficulty while testing.
• The sensor cannot be connected.



Future work:
The following section discusses the work that will be implemented with future releases of
the software.
1. Detailed categories: Future work could involve adding more categories which are more
detailed and has additional items.
2. Watch/Wish List: Work can add a watch list or wish list so that users can add an item to a
I will use that list to watch for item prices to go down or to see when there is a sale on any of those items.
3. Improved User Interface: Work on improving the user interface by including more interactive features.
4. Recommended Items: Add a bar that would display the most-recommended items, which
It would be determined by the number of times a user purchased an item.
5. Payment Options: Add different payment options, such as Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, etc.
where a user can also save the card information for later checkouts.
6. Shipping Options: Add different types of shipping options: regular shipping, expedited
shipping, international shipping, etc.
7. Recent History: Display the user’s recently browsed items in the recent-history tab. 
<h1>
Statemanagement
</h1>
I used the GetX State Management in this project. GetX is a powerful micro framework that we can use to manage states, provide routing, and conduct dependency injection.
Information transfer inside the program is allowed thanks to state management. Additionally, the application's state is changed whenever information is supplied, reconstructing the system. For flutter, GetX is an extremely effective and lightweight state management solution.

<h1>
Conclusion:
</h1>

This Ship-Shop clothing application was created for Android phones, which allows users to use it simply on their Android phones. The work for customers and admins is done differently. The customer can easily get the product they want or need, and the admin can add those products that are needed by the customer. The admins can get an idea of what kind of products they have to add to the system by allowing customers to rate and review the products they have purchased. This way, the relationship between customer and advertiser will be better. Overall, the main motive for building this application is to have a faster buying process, store, and product listing creation. There are no reach restrictions. Product and price comparison allows faster response to buyer/market demands, and it is also easy to use.
